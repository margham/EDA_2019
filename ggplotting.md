This is where I'll upload tutorials for remaking the daily lab assignments in GGPLOT!

>NOTE: This page will update as the course progresses, with the ggplot tutorials uploaded after you've had a chance to complete the assignments on your own, since many of them include spoilers :).

## General introduction:

## Remaking assignment graphics in GGPLOT:
