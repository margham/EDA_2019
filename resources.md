My tutorials are very specific to the EDA course, so they aren't a great all-purpose resource. But there is a whole Internet full of really amazing people who've made tutorials and guides for 

## Some of my favorite tutorials:

- The University of Edinburgh [Coding Club](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/){:target="_blank"}: This is one of the best collections of tutorials on the web, with tutorials covering nearly every topic you could hope for in R (and some Python), from basic introductions up to advanced data analysis and visualization. Check it out!

- [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html){:target="_blank"}: A completely free and comprehensive introduction to data manipulation and communication using R and the Tidyverse (a language for working in R developed by the inimitable [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/){:target="_blank"}). Can get a bit tedious, but you'll probably find whatever technical help you need here.  

- **Stack Overflow**: Not a tutorial per-se, but one of the greatest peer-to-peer resources available. Nearly every question you might have has been asked and answered ten different ways here!
