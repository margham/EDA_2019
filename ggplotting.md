# GGPLOTTING

This is where I'll upload tutorials for remaking the daily lab assignments in GGPLOT!

>NOTE: This page will update as the course progresses, with the ggplot tutorials uploaded after you've had a chance to complete the assignments on your own, since many of them include spoilers :).

## General introduction: 

- [ggplot2 Introduction](ggplot2.html){:target="_blank"}: Get familiar with the basic syntax using a data set built-in to r.

## Remaking assignment graphics in GGPLOT:

*add daily assigments here as they come available.*

## Further Resources:

*add links to tutorials here*
